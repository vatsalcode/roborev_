## Objective

 Designing an advanced Robot Reservation System aka Robo Rev, our project empowers users to effortlessly schedule and manage robot tasks by reserving time slots. This comprehensive software solution includes a robust analytics dashboard, enabling users to closely monitor and analyze reservation data alongside real-time robot performance metrics, all driven by sophisticated simulated data. By incorporating real-time robot performance metrics, users can make informed decisions, optimize resource allocation, and enhance overall operational efficiency.
